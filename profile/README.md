# MOSCOWNPUR STUDIOS
## How It Really Started

Picture this: a snowy Moscow night colliding with a sweaty Delhi afternoon. That’s basically how we were born — not in geography, but in vibe.
We didn’t want to make another boring platform where you type stuff, press save, and hope someone cares. Nah. We wanted to build a place where imagination actually feels like gameplay.
So we built Moscownpur. A half-mad, half-magical studio where:
Timelines aren’t linear, they’re puzzles.
Characters actually remember things.
Scenes feel like you’re hammering them out in a forge.
And when you publish, it doesn’t feel like “share to social” — it feels like tossing sparks into the real world.

## Why You’d Like It Here

This isn’t just “world-building.” It’s a game disguised as creation.
You start by naming your world. (Congratulations, you’re already a god.)
You pull characters out of dream wells. (They’ll nag you if you forget them.)
You face off against the Fog Dragon when you slack off. (Yes, even your guilt is lore now.)
You don’t just hit “export,” you throw open portals.
And if you’re wondering who keeps all this chaos stitched together? That would be our weird little mascot, Moscowvitz. Don’t ask where he came from. Even we don’t know.

## Under the Hood

Sure, there’s React, Supabase, Tailwind, Vercel… all that shiny tech stuff. But honestly? That’s just scaffolding. The fun part is the myth we’re all writing together.

## What We Swore To Do

Never let stories feel boring.
Never let creators feel alone.
Always let chaos have a seat at the table.
Moscownpur Studios is less “company” and more “impossible bar in a city that doesn’t exist.” You walk in, order a story, and end up running the place.
